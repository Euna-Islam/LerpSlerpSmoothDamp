# Unity Vector3 static methods
Lerp, Slerp, SmoothDamp, MoveTowards 

All of these are used to progress a Vector3 from a Start to an End vector.
## Lerp
Starts out fast, gets slower when target is near
## Slerp
While Lerp always gives a line, Slerp gives us points like the circumference of a circle which means it gives a uniform curve
## SmoothDamp
Starts slow, gets fast in the middle, gets slow at the end again
## MoveTowards
With MoveTowards object moves at a constant speed
